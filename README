App to help you learn Lojban.  (Could be used for other languages, if modified.)

Compilation requires https://github.com/Erhannis/LojbanCore - clone it and run `mvn clean install`.

Requires eSpeak to be installed on the device; search the Play store.

I extracted, cleaned, and used the dictionary file from udm.udmurtlyk.dictdata.engjbo "English-Lojban dictionary"; search the Play store.
